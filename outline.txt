The problem
  We all have PHP5 code bases
  PHP 5.6 is EOL on August 28, 2017 (ono)
  PHP 7.0 is being released in November (hopefully)
  21 month changeover period
  WHAT DO

DON'T PANIC
  Worst option: distros will probably support PHP5 for a while longer
  Less worse option: do a one way, flag day migration
  Better option: run on both for a while!

Methods
  If you don't have regression tests, start writing: it's the single best tool in your armory
  Just running code in PHP7 (in your development environment only!) will probably give you some useful errors and warnings, but be aware of the exception/error handling changes (more on that later)
